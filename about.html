I am always looking for job oppotrunity, feel free to contact me.

I am currently working for a IoT startup company. I am running 1 load balancer with 2 MQTT servers to route notification messages, plus a Laravel 5 application to serve REST API. I am also working with ESP8266 and Arduino as a beginner.
